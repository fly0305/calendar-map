## Contributing

PRs and contributions are welcome! However, before creating a pull request, please take a look at the [Github issues](https://github.com/patientslikeme/react-calendar-heatmap/issues) and open a new issue if your issue isn't found. It's good to validate what you want to do first, before spending time on writing the PR.

To develop on react-calendar-heatmap, a good way to start is to run the demo site. [See the demo README](demo/README.md) for instructions on how to run the demo.

Keep [CI tests](https://travis-ci.org/patientslikeme/react-calendar-heatmap) passing by running `yarn test` and `yarn run lint` often.
